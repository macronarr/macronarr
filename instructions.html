                    <p> Please read through the <a href="https://github.com/macronarr/macronarr/blob/main/MacroNarr_Documentation.pdf">MacroNarr Documentation</a> to familiarise yourself with the file preparation process and the outcome measures generated. Important points are summarised below. <br>
                    </p>

                  
                    <br>


                    <h5>File Preparation</h5>
                    <p> Your files for the MacroNarr analysis must be in simple csv format. No other file types are allowed for upload. The two required files are the following:

                    <ul>
                        <li>(1) a file containing the order of narrative propositions mentioned by each participant in a target/experimental group.</li>
                        <li>(2) a file containing the order of narrative propositions mentioned by each participant in a reference/control group.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                 
                    <br>

                    <h5>Major Considerations</h5>

                    <p> In these files, the first column <b>should always be made up of unique codes</b> that are (or include) string-based input, i.e., text. These represent individual narrative propositions (e.g. prop_a, prop_b, MC1, MC2 etc). If you do not include string for labelling unique propositions (e.g. if you use numbers like 1, 2, 3 throughout the column), then in the output generated by MacroNarr these number-based proposition codes will be converted to the format 'mc_(n of row)'. <br>

                    Additionally, while the first column is automatically assumed to contain unique codes for narrative propositions, <b>all other columns are assumed to represent data from unique participants </b>. In each participant’s column, you should mark the order in which the narrative propositions were mentioned using numbers, in ascending order of mention. If a proposition is repeated within the narrative, you can mark the order by appending a "+" symbol. <br>

                    <b>For marking the order of propositions</b> in participants’ columns, <b>ensure that only numbers are used</b>. The “+” symbol is also allowed, and is always assumed to be a marker of repetitions. If you include string-based input, i.e., text,  these observations will be excluded from analyses and you will also get a warning. <br>

                    Furthermore, you need to ensure that the <b>same unique codes</b> for propositions are used in the first column of </b>both your target and reference file</b>. If there are differences in this respect, you will get a warning. <br>

                    Moreover, it is <b>advised that you use informative names to label your two files</b>. If your files are identically named, this is not a problem for MacroNarr and analyses will proceed as normal. You will, however, get a warning to inform you of the identical labelling in case you accidentally uploaded duplicate files (see below). <br>

                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h5>"Trying it out"</h5>

                    <p>To use the MacroNarr tool, click on the “Try it out” page. You will have to initially <b>wait for ~20 seconds for the tool to load. This is because it is powered by Pyodide </b> (CPython in WebAssembly), which loads a Python interpreter and supporting libraries directly into your web browser. This process involves downloading and initializing the necessary components in your browser, which can take some time depending on your internet speed and device capabilities. Once loaded, the tool will operate smoothly without requiring any downloads or installations.<br>

                    Under Step 1, upload the file containing data from your target/experimental group. <br>
                    Under Step 2, upload the file containing data from your reference/control group. <br>
                    Under Step 3, select your desired output in the drop-down menu (see below for options). <br>
                    Finally, under Step 4, click “Run” once you have completed the above steps. <br>
                    MacroNarr analysis results will be displayed in the “Output” block-level container. <br>

                    </p>

                    <br>
                 

                    <h5>Measures Obtained</h5>

                    <p>The output options are: 

                    <ul>
                        <li><u>All output</u>: All of the options described below.</li>

                        <li><u>Unigram count (unique, total)</u>: Unigram count records frequency counts of single attested propositions and can be used as <b>a measure of informativeness</b> in narrative discourse production. It captures both the number of propositions attested once (unique count) as well as the total frequency of all attested propositions, including repeated ones (total count). This is a way to quantify the informativeness (i.e., richness, diversity of propositions) of narrative discourse samples. In parallel, it can identify less informative (e.g., fewer details of narrative content conveyed) or redundant narrative output through repetitions. </li>

                        <li><u>Bigrams and trigrams (bg, tg)</u>: Bigrams represent pairs of propositions mentioned in succession (e.g. MC1-MC7, MC7-MC9 etc), while trigrams represent triplets of consecutive propositions (e.g. MC1-MC7-MC9, MC7-MC9-MC15 etc). This measure yields the identities of bigrams and trigrams mentioned by each participant, listed in the order in which they were mentioned. It has been included for the reference of the user, making it possible to inspect whether there are differences in the combinations of propositions that have been most frequently attested in different participant samples. </li>

                        <li><u>Bg, tg & frequencies (based on reference)</u>: ): This measure is related to the one above. The difference in this case is that bigram and trigram identities are listed not in the order in which they were mentioned by each participant, but based on frequency ranks as determined based on data in the reference/control group. To explicate, this measure is based on the frequency with which bigram and trigram identities were attested across the whole of the reference/control group. These frequency counts undergo a subtraction of -1 (see justification under <a href="https://macronarr.github.io/macronarr/basics.html">Basics</a>); then, they become the values assigned to the same combinations that also appeared in each participant in the reference/control group and in the target/experimental group. </li>


                        <li><u>Associative Chunk Strength (ACS)</u>: ACS is the final measure yielded based on the measures described above. It averages across bigram and trigram values assigned to each participant, and yields individuals' ACS scores (Knowlton and Squire, 1994), <b>a measure of typicality in terms of narrative organisation</b>. One column is created for ASC scores (labelled “Mean”). See below for an example. </li>

                    </ul>

                    All the above measures are produced for both the reference/control group and the target/experimental group. They are displayed under the <a href="https://macronarr.github.io/macronarr/basics.html">Try it out</a> page in the “Output” block-level container and can be downloaded by clicking the “Download output.csv” button.
