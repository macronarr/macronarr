                    <h5>MacroNarr: Main Features</h5>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>Based on previous research</u>: MacroNarr uses constructs established by previous research to identify meaningful units of discourse for analysis. One such example is the Main Concept (MC) analysis by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1044/jshr.3801.145">Nicholas and Brookshire (1995)</a>. MCs are utterances with a single main verb, frequently produced by healthy individuals to communicate key elements of a stimulus (e.g. a picture). The aim of a MC analysis is to identify and evaluate utterances in discourse samples that match prespecified MCs, allowing researchers to establish to what extent core elements of a stimulus were communicated.</li>
                            <li><u>Taking a novel approach</u>: MCs have typically been manually scored as absent, accurate/inaccurate, complete/incomplete etc. MacroNarr differs from previous approaches in two main ways:<br> (1) it <b>quantifies the frequency of MCs</b> mentioned in succession to determine how <q>typical</q> each chunk of a narrative is in relation to reference data, using concepts inspired by the Artificial Language Learning literature <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-26196-001"> (Knowlton and Squire, 1994)</a> <br>
                            (2) it uses an <b>automated analysis</b> that requires minimal manual annotation by researchers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>MacroNarr: Steps and Key Terms</h5>
                    <p> Below is a simplified outline of the steps taken to complete the analysis using the MacroNarr tool. While step 1 and 2 are to be completed by the researcher using this tool, Step 3, 4 and 5 are automated.
                        <ol>
                            <li>1. For the MacroNarr analysis, a list of MCs commonly mentioned by controls is needed. For some narratives, publicly available lists exists. For the Cookie Theft picture, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1044/jshr.3801.145">Nicholas and Brookshire (1995)</a>. For the Broken Window, the Cinderella, and the Peanut Butter and Jelly narrative tasks, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02687038.2015.1057891">Richardson and Dalton (2016)</a>.</li>
                            <li>2. Once the list of MCs has been selected, the next step is to record the order with which single MCs (alternatively called <em>unigrams</em>) are mentioned by each participant in one's own research groups (target/experimental and a reference/control group).</li>
                            <li>3. Afterwards, the next step is to record the frequency with which combinations of two successive unigrams (called <em>bigrams</em>) and of three (called <em>trigrams</em>) were reported across the whole of the reference/control group.</li>
                            <li>4. Then, after we subtract -1 from each one of these frequency counts (*), they become the values we assign to the same combinations that also appeared in each participant in the reference/control group and in the target/experimental group.</li>
                            <li>5. By averaging across bigram and trigram values recorded for each participant, we obtain individuals' Associative Chunk Strength (ACS) scores, a measure of typicality in terms of narrative structure.</li>
                            <li>(*) Subtracting -1 from each frequency count corrects for the fact that every combination produced by a control is counted at least once, ensuring fairer comparisons by removing this baseline bias.</li>
                        </ol>
