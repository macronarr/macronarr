## What is MacroNarr? 

MacroNarr is a web-based tool for analysing narrative discourse. It allows users to analyse the frequency and sequential order of narrative propositions in both experimental and control groups. The tool computes propositional unigram counts, identifies bigrams and trigrams, and provides insights into the narrative organisation and informativeness of narrative discourse samples.

## Features and Measures

- **Unigram Count (Unique & Total)**: Quantifies the frequency of propositions, both unique and repeated, to measure informativeness.
- **Bigrams & Trigrams**: Identifies common pairs (bigrams) and triplets (trigrams) of propositions mentioned in succession.
- **Associative Chunk Strength (ACS)**: A novel measure of "typicality" in terms of narrative organisation, based on the commonality of bigrams and trigrams produced in a control sample.

## How to Use

1. Upload files containing the order of narrative propositions for both the target/experimental and reference/control groups.
2. The tool will process the data and generate unigram counts, bigram and trigram frequencies, and ACS.
3. Review the results and download them for further analysis.

## Requirements

- A web browser and internet connection.
- CSV files formatted according to the guidelines provided (see the [MacroNarr Documentation](https://github.com/macronarr/macronarr/blob/main/MacroNarr_Documentation.pdf)).

## Get Started

1. Visit the [MacroNarr website](https://macronarr.github.io/macronarr).
2. Click on the "Try it out" page.
3. Upload your files and wait for the analysis to complete.
